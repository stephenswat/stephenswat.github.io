Hello there! My name is Stephen, and I am currently a scientific software
developer at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). I work on
applying heterogeneous computing -- GPGPUs in particular -- to the
reconstruction of particles in high-energy collisions. I apply various
practical and theoretical performance engineering techniques and model in order
to prepare the field of high-energy physics for the data challenges of the
future.

Outside of work I like to cycle, play tabletop games of all kinds, take
photographs, cook, and commit myself to amateur botany. I am also very
interested in category theory, functional programming, type theory, and
computational trinitarianism, although my knowledge of these subjects is not
nearly as well developed as I would like it to be.

Please take a look around my website. Like any good academic, I have a blog
that I never update, outdated contact details, and probably a few dead links
here and there.
