Hello there! My name is Stephen, and I am currently a PhD student in computer
science at the University of Amsterdam in collaboration with the European
Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). Under the supervision of Ana-Lucia
Varbanescu and Attila Krasznahorkay, I work on applying heterogeneous computing
-- GPGPUs in particular -- to the reconstruction of particles in high-energy
collisions.

Outside of work I like to cycle and swim, play tabletop games of all kinds,
take photographs, cook, and commit myself to amateur botany. I am also very
interested in category theory, functional programming, type theory, and
computational trinitarianism, although my knowledge of these subjects is not
nearly as well developed as I would like it to be.

Please take a look around my website. Like any good academic, I have a blog
that I never update, outdated contact details, and probably a few dead links
here and there.
