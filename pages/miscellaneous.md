This page has some miscellaneous bits and bobs which don't fit anywhere else.

## People I follow

Back in the day, the internet used to be a decentralized system where websites
linked to and from each other. Nowadays, the internet is very different -- it's
a highly centralized system of silos owned by a handful of huge corporations.
Still, the decentralized internet (and no, I am not talking about any of that
"web 3.0" blockchain bollocks) is a beautiful idea, so here are some hyperlinks
to people -- mostly early career scientists -- whose work I find interesting:

* [Paul Gessinger](https://paulgessinger.com/): colleague and co-author,
  brilliant physicist and photographer
* [Uma Zalakain](https://umazalakain.info/): consistently interesting content
  on programming languages and type theory, among other topics

## Photography

I will never claim to be a competent photographer, but it is something that I
am interested in, and something that I enjoy learning more about. I own a Nikon
D3500 camera, with a NIKKOR 18--55mm f/3.5--5.6 kit lens, a NIKKOR 70-300mm
f/4.5--6.3 lens, a NIKKOR 50mm f/1.8 lens, a Sigma 24mm f/1.4 lens, and an Irix
15mm f/2.4 lens. I also own some vintage Soviet lenses.

My pictures are compositionally and technically simple, but that's okay. I also
really like birds!
